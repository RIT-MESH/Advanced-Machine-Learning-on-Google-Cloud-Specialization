# Advanced-Machine-Learning-on-Google-Cloud-Specialization

This 5-course specialization focuses on advanced machine learning topics using Google Cloud Platform where you will get hands-on experience optimizing, deploying, and scaling production ML models of various types in hands-on labs. This specialization picks up where “Machine Learning on GCP” left off and teaches you how to build scalable, accurate, and production-ready models for structured data, image data, time-series, and natural language text. It ends with a course on building recommendation systems. Topics introduced in earlier courses are referenced in later courses, so it is recommended that you take the courses in exactly this order.

Applied Learning Project

This specialization incorporates hands-on labs using our Qwiklabs platform.

These hands on components will let you apply the skills you learn in the video lectures. Projects will incorporate topics such as Google Cloud Platform products, which are used and configured within Qwiklabs. You can expect to gain practical hands-on experience with the concepts explained throughout the modules.

- ### Production Machine Learning Systems
In this course, we dive into the components and best practices of building high-performing ML systems in production environments. 
We cover some of the most common considerations behind building these systems, e.g. static training, dynamic training, static inference, dynamic inference, distributed TensorFlow, and TPUs. 
This course is devoted to exploring the characteristics that make for a good ML system beyond its ability to make good predictions.

- ### Computer Vision Fundamentals with Google Cloud
This course describes different types of computer vision use cases and then highlights different machine learning strategies for solving these use cases. The strategies vary from experimenting with pre-built ML models through pre-built ML APIs and AutoML Vision to building custom image classifiers using linear models, deep neural network (DNN) models or convolutional neural network (CNN) models. 

The course shows how to improve a model's accuracy with augmentation, feature extraction, and fine-tuning hyperparameters while trying to avoid overfitting the data. 
The course also looks at practical issues that arise, for example, when one doesn't have enough data and how to incorporate the latest research findings into different models.
Learners will get hands-on practice building and optimizing their own image classification models on a variety of public datasets in the labs they will work on.

- ### Natural Language Processing on Google Cloud
This course introduces the products and solutions to solve NLP problems on Google Cloud. Additionally, it explores the processes, techniques, and tools to develop an NLP project with neural networks by using Vertex AI and TensorFlow.

  - Recognize the NLP products and the solutions on Google Cloud.
  - Create an end-to-end NLP workflow by using AutoML with Vertex AI.
  - Build different NLP models including DNN, RNN, LSTM, and GRU by using TensorFlow.
  - Recognize advanced NLP models such as encoder-decoder, attention mechanism, transformers, and BERT.
  - Understand transfer learning and apply pre-trained models to solve NLP problems.

  
- ### Recommendation Systems on Google Cloud
  In this course, you apply your knowledge of classification models and embeddings to build a ML pipeline that functions as a recommendation engine.
